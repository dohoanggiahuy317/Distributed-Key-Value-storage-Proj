## minikeyvalue: A Simple Distributed Key-Value Store

Minikeyvalue is a lightweight (around 1000 lines of code) distributed key-value store written in Rust. It's designed for simplicity and scalability, making it a good option for storing large amounts of data (between 1MB and 1GB per value) across multiple machines. 

**Inspired by SeaweedFS, minikeyvalue offers several key advantages:**

* **Simple design:** It leverages standard tools like Nginx for volume serving and LevelDB for indexing, making it easy to understand and maintain.
* **Scalability:**  
    * Supports replication to ensure data redundancy and availability.
    * Can handle multiple machines and multiple storage drives per machine.
    * Designed to scale to billions of files and petabytes of data.
* **Production-ready:** Used in production at comma.ai, demonstrating its reliability.

**Here's a breakdown of how minikeyvalue works:**

* **Storage:**
    * Data is stored on the filesystem using Nginx as a volume server.
    * LevelDB is used to keep track of where data is located.
* **Key-Value API:**
    * Supports basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on key-value pairs.
    * Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, PUT, DELETE) for interaction.
    * Partially compatible with a subset of S3 requests for some S3 libraries.
* **Rebalancing and Rebuilding:**
    * Volumes (storage servers) can be added or removed to adjust storage capacity.
    * The LevelDB index can be rebuilt if necessary.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Start Volume Servers:** Run the `volume` binary on each machine that will store data, specifying a port and storage directory.
2. **Start Master Server:** Run the `mkv` binary with the `server` flag, specifying the LevelDB database path, volume server addresses (comma-separated), and desired options (port, replicas, etc.).

**Using the API:**

* You can use tools like `curl` to interact with the API.
* Refer to the readme for specific commands for various operations (e.g., putting data, getting data, deleting data).

**Rebalancing and Rebuilding:**

* The readme provides instructions on how to rebalance volumes (change the number of storage servers) and rebuild the LevelDB index.

**Performance:**

The readme also includes some performance benchmarks for fetching nonexistent keys.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided project description seems to be referring to a separate project, not directly related to minikeyvalue.

I hope this detailed explanation helps you understand minikeyvalue better!
